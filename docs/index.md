# Mitoverse

[Mitoverse](https://mitoverse.i-med.ac.at) is our graphical execution platform providing tools for mitochondrial sequencing data analysis.

The following tools are currently available:

* [mtDNA-Server 2](mtdna-server/mtdna-server.md) for mtDNA variant analysis. **Published in [Nucleic Acids Research, 2024](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/W1/W102/7665634).**
* [Haplocheck](haplocheck/haplocheck.md) for in-sample contamination detection starting from BAM or VCF files. **Published in [Genome Research, 2021](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/31/2/309).**

## Haplogroup Classification
We also developed Haplogrep 3, a tool for mtDNA haplogroup classification available as a [web service](https://haplogrep.i-med.ac.at/). **Published in [Nucleic Acids Research, 2023](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/51/W1/W263/7127219).**

!!! note 
    All tools are also available for download and can be run via the command line.
