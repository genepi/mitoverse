# Mitoverse

[Mitoverse](https://mitoverse.i-med.ac.at) is our graphical execution platform providing tools for mitochondrial sequencing data analysis, developed at our institute.

The following tools are currently available:

* [mtDNA-Server 2](mtdna-server/mtdna-server.md) for mtDNA variant analaysis.
* [Haplocheck](haplocheck/haplocheck.md) for in-sample contamination detection starting from BAM or VCF files.

## Haplogroup Classification
We also developed Haplogrep 3, a tool for mtDNA haplogroup classification available as a [web service](https://haplogrep.i-med.ac.at/).

!!! note 
    All tools are also available for download and can be run via the command line.
