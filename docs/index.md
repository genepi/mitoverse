# Welcome to Haplocheck!

Haplocheck is a contamination detection tool using the mtDNA phylogeny. Haplochecks only requires the mitochondrial genome as an input to detect contamination in both **mtDNA** and **whole-genome sequencing studies**. 
It can therefore be used as a proxy for a quick contamination check. 

You can upload alignment files (BAM,CRAM) or variant files (vcf format) and receive a graphical and textual report which can be shared with collaborators. 

We provide haplocheck as a [standalone pipeline](https://github.com/genepi/haplocheck#run-haplocheck-locally) and as a [cloud web service](https://mitoverse.i-med.ac.at).
