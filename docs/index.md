# Welcome to Mitoverse!

Mitoverse provides several tools for mtDNA data analysis. Currently the tools haplocheck and mtDNA-Server are available. To run the tool click [here](https://mitoverse.i-med.ac.at).

## Haplocheck 

Haplocheck is a contamination detection tool using the mtDNA phylogeny. Haplochecks only requires the mitochondrial genome as an input to detect contamination in both **mtDNA** and **whole-genome sequencing studies**. 
It can therefore be used as a proxy for a quick contamination check. 

You can upload alignment files (BAM,CRAM) or variant files (vcf format) and receive a graphical and textual report which can be shared with collaborators. 

We provide haplocheck as a [standalone pipeline](https://github.com/genepi/haplocheck#run-haplocheck-locally) and as a [cloud web service](https://mitoverse.i-med.ac.at).

## mtDNA-Server 2 

mtDNA-Server provides a free service for the analysis of human mitochondrial DNA data, currently focusing on reliable identification of homoplasmic and heteroplasmic sites (>= 1%).
