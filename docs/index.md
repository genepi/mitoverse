# Haplocheck

Haplocheck is a contamination detection tool using the mtDNA phylogeny. You can upload alignment files (BAM,CRAM) or variant files (vcf, vcf.gz) and receive a graphical and textual report which can be shared with collaborators. 

Haplocheck has been integrated into [mitoverse](https://mitoverse.i-med.ac.at),  a platform for mitochondrial (mtDNA) apps & data. The overall goal is to provide a universe of apps that help researchers analysing mtDNA data. 

## Haplocheck Workflow
Currently the workflow includes the following steps:

* Variant and Heteroplasmy Detection 
* Haplogroup Detection with Haplogrep2
* Contamination Detection
* Graphical Report Creation

Haplocheck is already available in mitoverse. Please click [here](https://mitoverse.i-med.ac.at/index.html#!run/haplocheck) to run your first contamination check.
