# Haplocheck

Haplocheck is a contamination detection tool using the mtDNA phylogeny. You can upload alignment files (BAM,CRAM) or variant files (vcf, vcf.gz) and receive a graphical and textual report which can be shared with collaborators. 

We provide haplocheck as a [standalone pipeline](https://github.com/genepi/haplocheck#run-haplocheck-locally) and as a cloud web service (via https://mitoverse.i-med.ac.at).
