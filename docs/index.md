# Mitoverse

[Mitoverse](https://mitoverse.i-med.ac.at) is a platform for mitochondrial (mtDNA) apps & data. The overall goal is to provide a universe of apps that help researchers analysing mtDNA data. Mitoverse is based on [Cloudgene](http://www.cloudgene.io/), a plugable cloud platform for genomic research.

## Haplocheck

Haplocheck is a contamination detection tool using the mtDNA phylogeny.. You can upload alignment files (BAM,CRAM) or variant files (vcf, vcf.gz) and receive a graphical and textual report which can be shared with collaborators.

Currently the workflow includes the following steps:

* Variant and Heteroplasmy Detection 
* Haplogroup Detection with Haplogrep2
* Contamination Detection
* Graphical Report Creation

Haplocheck is already available in mitoverse. Please click [here](https://mitoverse.i-med.ac.at/index.html#!run/haplocheck) to run your first contamination check.

## Haplogrep

[Haplogrep](http://haplogrep.uibk.ac.at) is a widely used tool for haplogroup detection. You can upload data in fasta or vcf format and receive haplogroups in return. This app will follow shortly.
