# Welcome to Mitoverse

Mitoverse is an analysis platform and provides several tools for the analysis of mitoochondrial sequencing data. 

Currently the following tools are available: 

* [mtDNA-Server 2](mtdna-server/mtdna-server.md) for mtDNA variant analaysis.
* [Haplocheck](haplocheck/haplocheck.md) for in-sample contamination detection starting from BAM or VCF files.

To run the tools you can either use our [cloud web service](https://mitoverse.i-med.ac.at) or download it from Github.

## Haplogroup Classification
For mtDNA haplogroup classification, we developed **Haplogrep**. If you want to use Haplogrep as a stand-alone tool, you can download it from [here](https://github.com/genepi/haplogrep3) or use our [cloud web service](https://haplogrep.i-med.ac.at/).
