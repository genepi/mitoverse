# Welcome to Mitoverse

Mitoverse is an analysis platform and provides several tools for the analysis of mtDNA sequencing reads. 

Currently the following tools are available: 

* [Haplocheck](haplocheck/haplocheck.md) for in-sample contamination detection starting from BAM or VCF files.
* [mtDNA-Server](mtdna-server/mtdna-server.md) for mtDNA variant detection as a service. 
* [Mutserve](mutserve/mutserve.md) for local mtDNA variant detection (used by mtDNA-Server).

To run the tools you can either use our [cloud web service](https://mitoverse.i-med.ac.at) or download it from Github.
