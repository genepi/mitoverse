Haplocheck reports the contamination level for each sample. The overall table includes the (a) Contamination Status, (b) Haplogroup Distance between both components, (c) Major Level (%) and the (d) Minor Level (%). Haplogroup reports two levels, since a contamination is possible on both haplogroup components (major and minor).

To check for contamination in detail, we provide for each mixture a graphical representation of the phylogenetic tree. The tree starts at the root node (rCRS) and shows homoplasmic (blue) / heteroplasmic (green) positions for each transition.
